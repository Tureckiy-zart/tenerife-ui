All visual values (colours, typography, spacing, radii, shadows, transitions) are defined as tokens in dedicated files under a tokens folder.

A theme system allows overriding the entire design by editing a single file under the /themes directory. Components are fully controlled: they maintain no internal state and expose all data via props. This design ensures the library works in any project, supports multiple themes (default, dark, brand-specific), and maintains complete separation between style tokens and business logic."
