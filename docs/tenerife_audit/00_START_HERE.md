### Before (Current)

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Event Name                 │  ← System fonts
│  Date • Venue               │  ← Default styling
│  Description text...        │  ← No effects
│  €20        [Get Tickets]   │  ← Basic button
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### After (Target)

```
╔═══════════════════════════════╗
║  ✨ EVENT NAME ✨            ║  ← Custom fonts + gradient

## 🔥 Most Critical Findings

1. **❌ No Visual Design System**
   - Using system fonts (looks generic)
   - No brand colors beyond basic primary
   - No premium effects (glass, gradients, glows)

2. **❌ Not Mobile-Optimized**
   - Components not responsive
   - Poor mobile UX
   - 70% of nightlife traffic is mobile

3. **❌ Inconsistent Component APIs**
   - Mixed patterns across components
   - Hard to learn and use
   - Slows development

4. **❌ Complex Components Need Refactor**
   - EventCard: 225 lines (should be <100)
   - VenueCard: 206 lines (should be <100)
   - FilterBar: 313 lines (should be <150)

5. **❌ Limited Component Variants**
   - Most components have 1 style
   - No flexibility
   - Requires custom styling

---

## ✅ What's Already Good

1. ✅ **71 Components** - Comprehensive coverage
2. ✅ **TypeScript** - Type safety throughout
3. ✅ **Modern Stack** - Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, CVA
4. ✅ **Accessibility** - ARIA patterns via Radix
5. ✅ **Storybook** - Component documentation

**Translation:** Solid foundation, needs visual polish
