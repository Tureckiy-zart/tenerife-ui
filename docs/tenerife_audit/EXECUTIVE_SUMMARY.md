**Total Investment:** ~1.75 FTE × 10 weeks = **17.5 person-weeks**

### Budget Estimate (Rough)

Assuming typical rates:

- Senior Engineer: €1,000/day × 50 days = €50,000
- Designer: €800/day × 25 days = €20,000
- QA: €600/day × 10 days = €6,000
- **Total: ~€76,000**

_(Adjust for actual rates and location)_
